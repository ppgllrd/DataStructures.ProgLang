# Simplified implementation of singly linked lists in C++

Without using new features in latest versions of C++ like:
+ auto for type inference.
+ smart pointers for dynamic memory managment.

Without using:
+ Pure virtual methods an abstract classes for abstraction (Java like interfaces).
+ virtual methods in class definitions.
